# CS50x

Hello, world! You are cordially invited to attend one or more of CS50’s (free!) New Year’s Seminars, each of which will be taught live via Zoom. Each will be offered on multiple days at multiple times to accommodate time zones. You just need a computer with an internet connection to attend!

Each seminar offers a taste of topics taught in more detail in CS50’s full courses. You are encouraged (but not required!) to register with one or more colleagues, family members, or friends with whom to work on the seminar together!

Before registering, be sure that

1. you have a GitHub account, which you can create at github.com/join, if you don’t have already,
2. you have logged into Ed, the course’s discussion forum, at least once at cs50.ly/seminars/ed,
3. you have an edX account, which you can create at courses.edx.org/register, if you don’t have already, and
4. you have registered for CS50x at cs50.edx.org or one of CS50’s other courses at edx.org/cs50, if you haven’t already.

Register at cs50.ly/seminars.

If you would potentially like to volunteer as a mentor for any of these seminars, helping others online with the material, if you are already comfortable with the material yourself, let us know at cs50.ly/seminars too.
