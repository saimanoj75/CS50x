# A Taste of Linux

Before attending this seminar: be sure you have a GitHub account, which you can create at [GitHub] (github.com/join), if you don’t have already; be sure you can log into [Seminars](cs50.ly/seminars/ed); and be sure you can log into ide.cs50.io.

Join us for a taste of Linux, a popular operating system used by CS50 IDE (CS50’s web-based programming environment) and many of the world’s servers! While Linux can have a graphical user interface (GUI), Linux is particularly known for its (powerful!) command-line interface (CLI), which is entirely keyboard-based. Although it takes practice, a command-line interface tends to be faster than a graphical interface, which means you can get more work done more quickly! In this seminar, we’ll introduce you to basic commands like “cd,” “ls,” “mkdir”, “rm,” and “rmdir” and also more powerful commands like “cat”, “grep,” “sed,” and more. Plus, we’ll introduce you to “pipes” and input/output “redirection”! 🤯 Prior programming experience (in any programming language) recommended but not required. Taught by CS50’s own Kareem Zidane.

This seminar will offered four times. Each offering will be identical. If you would like to attend, you need only attend once. Register for any of these times at [Seminar](cs50.ly/seminars).
